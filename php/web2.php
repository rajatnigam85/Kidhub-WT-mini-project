            Once when a lion, the king of the jungle, was asleep, a little mouse began running up and down on him. This soon awakened the lion, who placed his huge paw on the mouse, and opened his big jaws to swallow him.<br>
            "Pardon, O King!" cried the little mouse. "Forgive me this time. I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness. And who knows, I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days!<br>
            The lion was so tickled by the idea of the mouse being able to help him that he lifted his paw and let him go.
            Sometime later, a few hunters captured the lion, and tied him to a tree. After that they went in search of a wagon, to take him to the zoo.<br>
            Just then the little mouse happened to pass by. On seeing the lionâ€™s plight, he ran up to him and gnawed away the ropes that bound him, the king of the jungle.<br>
            "Was I not right?" said the little mouse, very happy to help the lion.<br>
